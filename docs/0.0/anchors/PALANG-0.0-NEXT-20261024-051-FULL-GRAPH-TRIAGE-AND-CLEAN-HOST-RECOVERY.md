# NEXT-051 — Full Graph Triage and Clean-Host Recovery

- Stable ID: `G6IP-RAHM-NEXT-051-20261024`
- Production ID: `G6IP-NEXT-051`
- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: OPEN / LIVING / NOT COMPLETE.
- Parent: [CURRENT-057](./PALANG-0.0-CURRENT-20261024-057-REPOSITORY-EXCAVATION-AND-LIVING-RECOVERY.md)
- Preserve existing gates: [NEXT-050](./PALANG-0.0-NEXT-20261024-050-FULL-RECOVERY-AND-REAL-HOST-IMPORT.md), [NEXT-049](./PALANG-0.0-NEXT-20261024-049-REAL-HOST-TRANSFER-AND-GRAPH-AUDIT.md)

## Ordered actions
1. Independently fetch/read back Point 0/006, IN-050, OUT-049, EVT-0159, CURRENT-057, NEXT-051, portable master, manifest, canonical index and main integration queue.
2. Re-run the strict portable conformance workflow after the new files and mother/index/queue changes. Reconcile exact-byte SHA-256 values and package digest from raw workflow receipts.
3. Verify relative links for the new chain and all touched mother/index/queue files; record any broken destinations individually.
4. Extend IN/OUT recovery from link/checkpoint equivalence to full canonical-state reconstruction: parent chain, versions, event IDs, evidence receipts, failure/correction pairs and every OPEN gate must match.
5. Triage the repository-wide audit one finding at a time: 11 missing links, 60 unreviewed stable-ID collision groups, 88 production-ID collision groups, 7 reference-ID collision groups, 36 event-number collision groups and 13 ambiguous parent edges. No bulk deletion or speculative renumbering.
6. Import the export package into a clean independent AI host with no prior chat context, only if a real authorized host is available. Record actual host/model, capability manifest, reconstruction result and independent read-back. CI is not a separate AI host.
7. Test a second host, persistent memory after restart, and idle/background execution only in an actual authorized runtime. Otherwise retain OPEN / NOT VERIFIED / BLOCKED.
8. Update living master, canonical index, main queue and manifest only with evidence, then independently fetch each changed file and compare.
9. Deliver a visible user-facing result at each durable milestone; do not claim background work between turns.

## Acceptance criteria
- New artifacts and updated canonical destinations pass read-back and focused link checks.
- All manifest file digests match exact bytes and the package archive hash is recorded.
- Independent IN and OUT recovery reconstruct identical canonical state and preserve all open gates.
- Clean-host import proves recovery without hidden chat context, or remains explicitly NOT RUN.
- Repository graph findings are individually adjudicated or remain open with evidence.
- No unverified item is closed.

## Always-open rule
NEXT-051 remains OPEN/LIVING until all required acceptance criteria have evidence. NEXT-049 and NEXT-050 remain open independently.


## Latest excavation recheck — run 40124425936 / 2026-10-24
- Structural audit workflow completed, but content result remains `REVIEW_REQUIRED`: 3,757 files including generated evidence; 5,564 local-link edges; 16 missing links; 62 stable-ID collision groups (61 unreviewed); 88 production-ID collision groups; 7 reference-ID collision groups; 36 event-number collision groups; 13 ambiguous parent edges; 0 decode errors.
- Strict portable conformance run [40124425568](https://github.com/ahmadnezhadhosseini64-cloud/future-ai-palang-footprint/actions/runs/40124425568) passed for manifest v1.4.2: schema valid fixture 0 errors, invalid fixture rejected with 4 errors, all expected file digests matched, limited IN/OUT checkpoint-link equivalence passed; package 44 files / 221380 bytes / SHA-256 `591377d03546e6f031ee98614b1c9fbd662dba08a15bc5c68b15bd918282f501`.
- These are repository/CI results only. Full IN/OUT state reconstruction, clean/second AI-host import, actual persistence restart and idle/background execution remain OPEN / NOT VERIFIED.
